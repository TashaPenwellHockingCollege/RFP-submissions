Augmented Reality has transformed the marketing opportunities and experiences for organizations, brands and services.  LensStudio and SparkAR are specifically creatd to develop AR activities for popular social media platforms such as Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram.  In addition to the developer support, these AR activities are easily shared at a low cost to reach a wider variety of audience faster and at a lower cost than many other marketing methods.  In addition to creating these platform specific interactive experiences, marketers can also develop for the open web with no app dependencies using technology from Amazon Sumerian and other supporting AWS services.

This workshop will introduce the basics of building on these platforms, use cases and how to derive marketing insights from user engagement.

Provide a concise public-facing description for the session (limited to 600 characters or less). This will be published in the program along with the title, so it’s the public face of your session.

Augmented Reality (AR) has transformed the marketing opportunities and experiences for organizations, brands, and services.  LensStudio and SparkAR are specifically created to develop AR activities for popular social media platforms such as Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram.  In addition to the platform developer support, these AR activities are easily shared at a low cost to reach a wider variety of audiences faster and at a lower cost than many other marketing methods.  The third type of AR platform we'll be reviewing is Amazon Sumerian built on the AWS Cloud infrastructure.  This web-based, platform-agnostic technology enables developers and marketers to develop for the open web with no app dependencies.

This workshop will introduce the basics of building on these platforms, use cases, and how to derive marketing insights from user engagement.  
Pitch us on your session: demonstrate to the reviewers why you should be presenting this session. How will this address a compelling need? Who are your panelists and what are their qualifications (if applicable)? Why are you passionate about this topic? This content will only be visible to the review committee.
Augmented reality is quickly growing for a variety of use cases and one of the bigger ones is for marketing.  I began developing AR experiences in March 2020 to assist small business owners who were struggling to stay in business when the Covid pandemic required shutdowns and quarantines.  Since then, my experience and interest in the use cases of this technology have grown into a wider audience with a deeper exploration to provide more engaging experiences for a business's customer.  

In order to reach a diverse demographic, I've developed for the Snapchat platform that reaches age groups 13 - 24, with Facebook and Instagram being mostly used by individuals over 34 years of age.  For smaller businesses who are looking to develop AR experiences for marketing, training, or other purposes Amazon Sumerian is a great option with its only dependency being Internet access. 

The target panelists are individuals who are looking to expand their marketing techniques to create an engaging and memorable experience for their brand.
Please create a 60-second video pitching your submission to the committee. Visually show us how you’ll make use of a virtual medium. Let us see your passion for your topic. Upload it unlisted to Youtube (or similar) and include a link.
